# Work Music

Music is an integral part of how I work. Most often when I am working on a task, music is playing in the background.

The music I choose to listen to while working has a few specific traits to it. If I were to try and focus while programming, something like Metallica would be more of a distraction than anything else. Instead, I listen to music that meets two requirements: ambient sounding, and no vocals.

Additionally, I break up the music I listen to by task. What's playing while I do housework will be different than what I program to. Having specific music for each task helps me focus more, as simply hearing that particular music puts me into the proper mindset for that task. All of the music I listen to is managed through [iTunes' Smart Playlists](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19487) and stored on my computer. I want all of the music to always be available and not have to worry about any of the artists pulling their music from any streaming service.

For programming, my music of chocie is slower ambient electronic music. My playlist for this consists largely of releases by [Ultimae Records](https://ultimae.com) and includes artists like [AES Dana](http://aesdana.free.fr/aesdana/News.html), [Martin Nonstatic](https://ultimae.com/artists/martin-nonstatic/), and [Solar Fields](http://www.solarfields.com).

When I am working around the house, my listening is split between podcasts and [SomaFM](https://somafm.com). I have been a fan of SomaFM for over a decade, and regularly fall back to it when I can't decide what else to listen to. [Space Station Soma](https://somafm.com/spacestation/) is my favorite station to listen to, but I also regularly listen to [Drone Zone](https://somafm.com/dronezone/) and [Deep Space One](https://somafm.com/deepspaceone/).

I take a different approach when I am writing and solely rely on the music of [Ben Prunty](https://benprunty.com). Most of Pruny's material is game music of an electronic nature. Two of my favorite albums of his are [Color Sky](https://benprunty.bandcamp.com/album/color-sky) and [Fragments](https://benprunty.bandcamp.com/album/fragments), both of which I listen to at least once a week.
