# About The Author

Hello! My name is Paul Krueger, and welcome to my little piece of the [intertubes](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Intertubes).

This site is a place for me to write about what interests me. This typically will be topics related to design, gaming, and technology.

While my day job is not related to technology, I have a passion for both learning about the latest technological advances and for contributing in some form. In recent years, I have worked alongside [Evan Korn](http://ekorndesign.com) as a freelance web developer. Web documents more than any other programming task interests me the most, and so my focus remains on doing that to the best of my abilities.

## Gaming

For as long as I can remember, I have loved video games. From playing the original [Super Mario Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.) on the [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) to modern day [MOBAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena) on the PC, there are very few game genres that I do not enjoy.

I have owned many consoles in the past, but most of my gaming nowadays is on PC. It is currently equipped as such:

- CPU: [Intel Core i7-6700](http://ark.intel.com/products/88196/Intel-Core-i7-6700-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4_00-GHz)
- GPU: [GeForce GTX 780](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-780)
- RAM: [ADATA AX4U2133W4G13-DRZ 8GB DDR4-2133](http://www.adata.com/en/xpg-dram/orderinfo/305)
- SSD: [Intel 330 60GB](http://ark.intel.com/products/67286/Intel-SSD-330-Series-60GB-SATA-6Gbs-25nm-MLC) & [Samsung 850 EVO 120GB](http://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-850-evo-2-5-sata-iii-120gb-mz-75e120b-am/)

This system is connected to an [LG 25UM58-P](http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-25UM58-P-ultrawide-monitor), a 25‚Äù monitor running 2560x1080 at 75hz. For games that are best played with a controller, I use a [Steam Controller](http://store.steampowered.com/app/353370/).

I also own a [Nintendo 2DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_2DS), a [Wii U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U) and a [Sony Playstation 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3), but none of them are used heavily anymore.
