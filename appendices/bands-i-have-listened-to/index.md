This page is split into two sections. The first section lists which bands I have listened to the complete discography for. The second section are bands that I have sampled, usually by listening to a [greatest hits album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_hits_album) or an essentials playlist on Apple Music.

Note: As of now, this is an incomplete list. I am still working through a list of artists I know I have listened to, making sure that I have listened to all that is available by them before moving on to the next.
