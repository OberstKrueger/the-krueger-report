# Tracking Sleep

While much of the focus on the [Apple Watch][1] has centered around notifications and interactions between it and the phone, what interests me most about the device is using it for new tasks that the [iPhone][2] and my [Mac Mini][3] can not do. The big area that the Apple Watch can do that the other devices can not is health tracking.

Since it is a worn device with a [built-in accelerometer and gyroscope][4], the Apple Watch is perfect for tracking my body's movement and recording health data. Obvious uses of this is for tracking exercise and total steps walked, but one area that Apple doesn't advertise is the ability for the Apple Watch to function as a sleep monitor. Apple does not provide their own app for doing so, but there are third party apps for monitoring one's sleep.

The app I use to track my sleep is [Sleep++][5], by [David Smith][6]. Every night when I go to sleep, I open up the app on my Apple Watch and tap "Start Sleeping". That's it, nothing needs to be done until the morning.

Sleep++ is not a simple timer for when you sleep. It makes use of the motion tracking capabilities of the Watch to determine when you are sleeping. Whenever I wake up and move around at night, it stores this information. In the morning, it presents a graph of the night's sleep, showing when I was restful and when I was not.

In addition, Sleep++ syncs with [Apple Health][7], allowing me to add it to the overall picture of my health. This makes it easy to see graphs of how well I have slept throughout the past week, month, or year.

In the past, I have used [Sleep Cycle][8], but this method presented many problems. Having my phone laying on the bed next to me left me nervous that I was going to roll over and knock it off of the bed, losing out on the sleep tracking and/or damaging the phone. Sleep Cycle now uses a method that captures the sound in the room to determine restfulness, but since I am not the only one sleeping in the same bed, I worry about inaccuracies in its recording.

Unrelated to Sleep++, the Apple Watch makes a great alarm clock. The Watch is able to wake me up with a light tapping that is not jarring and also does not disturb Whitney. While I typically wake up on my own before I need to, this makes a great backup in case I sleep in longer than I should.

The one downside to using Sleep++ revolves around charging the device. It seems typical that people charge their smartwatches at night while they sleep, much like they would any other device. But wearing a device all night requires a new routine to make sure the device does not die in the middle of the day.

[David Smith's recommendation][9] to do this is to charge it while you are getting ready in the morning for about 20-30 minutes, and the same amount of time at night as you get ready for bed, and to turn [Airplane Mode][10] on while you sleep. This method works well, and using it, I have never run out of battery during the day.
