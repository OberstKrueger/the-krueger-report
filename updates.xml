<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>In recent years, the amount of time I spend exercising has lessened. I would occasionally exercise, but it kept becoming more sporadic. Weight gain has been steady since I left college, and especially since we moved up here to Oregon.</p>

<p>In an attempt to help alleviate these problems, I looked back at how I exercised in college and recreated a similar routine. I have been following this <a href="https://krueger.report/health/exercise-routine">exercise routine</a> for a few months now, and while I am still perfectin certain aspects of it, I have found it easy to keep up with and it is helping my weight and overall health.</p>

<h3>Updates</h3>

<p>AutoSleep is now the app I use for <a href="https://krueger.report/health/tracking-sleep">tracking my sleep</a>. There are a number of improvements that it has over Sleep++, with the main one being that I no longer have to manually enable it every night and disable it every morning. It just worksâ„¢. </p>

<p>6 months ago, I wrote my first steps to completely <a href="https://krueger.report/technology/logging-off-facebook">logging off Facebook</a>. Since then, I have missed Facebook not in the slightest. The other night, I reopened my account just so I can go in and initiate the full deletion of the account. Before doing that, I looked around at the news feed and the walls of a few of my friends. My decision to cut back on social media has been solidified. Facebook has not changed in the 6 months since I stopped using it, and it probably never will. My life is better without it.</p>

<p>I am at the end of building the list of <a href="https://krueger.report/gaming/games-i-have-played">Games I Have Played</a>. All major systems have their games entered and linked up to further information about the game. I know there are going to be random games here and there that I have not entered due to not remembering them. But as now, this is the most complete list of every game I have played. And it is much bigger than I anticipated.</p>

<p>And finally, this month's new game was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango#Remastered_version">Grim Fandango Remastered</a>. Overall, it was an enjoyable game, and a fun revisit to one of my favorite adventure games of all time. But as much as I enjoyed playing through it, adventure games of this style do not hold me the way that they used to. I love everything about this game, except for the gameplay. Too bad it's not a movie, or a TV miniseries, or something else along those lines.</p>

<h3>A New Format... Again</h3>

<p>Before getting into other topics, I would be remiss to not talk about the slightly new format on here. When I created this site, I initially started it out as a standard blog, where I would post every few weeks. These were my &quot;notes&quot;. After 10 months of doing this, I created the &quot;book&quot;, which took the same content, but acted as my most up-to-date versions of those writings. I tried to make the two sit together, but this ended up being more work than I enjoyed.</p>

<p>The &quot;book&quot; portion of the site ended up being the more fun part for me. While I do not wish to put unfinished work up, the nature of some of what I enjoy writing about is that it will never be complete, or it would become outdated at some point.</p>

<p>The solution I have come up with is to combine the two into one. Now, The Krueger Report is just one piece that more closely resembles the &quot;book&quot; portion of the old version.</p>

<p>My writing will still be the same as it was before. The way I write is to focus on a single topic each month, and work on completing that. I will be maintaining that schedule, but instead of a separate &quot;notes&quot; section, I will post updates to both this page as well as a new Atom feed that can be subscribed to. This feed will show periodical updates, linking to the new pages I have written, along with quick summaries of what I have updated. Much like this very update.</p>

<h3>Software Tools</h3>

<p>Anyone who knows me knows that I am incredibly picky about what software I use. I will painstakingly research as many possibilities as I can for any application type that I use.</p>

<p>There has always been a set of criteria that I follow, but I wanted to write down exactly what they were, instead of just leaving it a bit nebulous in my head. The last few months, I made notes about my thinking as I evaluated new applications. When reviewing these notes, I found that they were all related to five specific criteria.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://krueger.report/technology/software-tools">Software Tools</a>, I wrote up what these five criteria are. In the future, this will also be where I delve into specific examples of applications that I currently use, and how they make use of all of the rules set forth.</p>

<h3>Updates</h3>

<p><a href="https://krueger.report/gaming/games-i-have-played/">Games I Have Played</a> saw the biggest change this month. I began to add console systems and mobile games to the list, as well as breaking out the list into different sections based on the platform the game was played on. This page is time consuming, as I have played a lot of games in my life, but it is one of my favorite to go back and research, just to remember again the many games I have played but since forgotten. There is a lot of work to do yet on this list, but it is shaping up to being closer to where I want it to be.</p>
